```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## **Lab 2**
```{r}
choco <- read.csv("https://xdaiisu.github.io/ds202materials/hwlabs/choco.csv")
head(choco)
```

**1.**
```{r}
hist <- hist(choco$Rating, main="Chocolate Ratings", xlab="Ratings", col="brown")
text(hist$mids, hist$counts, label=hist$counts, adj=c(1, 0.08))
```

The histogram is roughly normally distributed with most of the ratings being around 3. Outliers exist for rating equal to 5 and less than 2.

**2.**
```{r}
plot(choco$Cocoa.Pct, choco$Rating, main="Cocoa Pt. vs Ratings", xlab="Cocoa Pt", ylab="Ratings")
```

Based on the scatterplot, we can say that there is no to very weak correlation between cocoa percentage and ratings. For different cocoa percentages, different ratings exist and vice-versa.
